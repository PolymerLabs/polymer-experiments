 What this demo demonstrates:

 - Phase 1: index.html loads with top-level app structure and enough styling
            to get non-upgraded elements into place.

 - Phase 2: critical.html loads async, carrying just Polymer and `my-app`
            definition.  `my-app` is a body type extension that implements
            Polymer.LightDomBindingBehavior, which scans its light-DOM template
            for bindings (rather than a template).  At this point, my-app
            upgrades and can poke any data brought in the critical section
            (e.g. "lorem ipsum") into its template, and definitions for
            non-critical elements are async lazy-loaded.

 - Phase 3: elements.html loads async, carrying remaining element definitions
            `x-produces` and `x-consumes`.  These elements upgrade and are
            late-bound to any host data and can participate in normal
            binding with the host.

  Throttle the loading speed in the devtools Network panel to ~"Good 3G" to
  get a nice view of the 3 phases.

<!--
  If my-app didn't need event handlers, default data, computed functions,
  etc. and only needed binding ala dom-bind, it could just use is="body-bind",
  which is a no-frills implementation of Polymer.LightDomBindingBehavior.
  Since we do, using the behavior on a `body` Custom Element type extension
  allows us to write the top-level app element idiomatically using all the
  features of a normal element.
